# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Winter-22-23
# Exercises

by Lonan Keane

This repository contains a folder containing the exercises for the topics statistics, models, and parameters as well as the Keras project

## Setup

To install Jupyter, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can check if you have Python installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```python --version```

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/)

Once you have Python installed, you can use pip, the Python package manager, to install Jupyter. Run the following command in your terminal to install Jupyter:

```pip install jupyter```

This will install Jupyter and its dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, you can start the Jupyter server by running the following command in your terminal:

```jupyter notebook```

This will open a new browser window with the Jupyter dashboard.



## running the notebooks

You can open a notebook by clicking on its name in the dashboard

## What to expect

This repository contain the notebooks for the exercises in the 3 topics, statistics, models and parameters.
